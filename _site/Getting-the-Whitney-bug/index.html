        <p>As a milestone birthday approached, my beautiful and wonderful wife asked what I wanted to do to celebrate. With it being a “milestone”, she said we should do something a bit bigger than a normal birthday. We discussed going several places or taking a cruise or doing something along those lines. Then she asked if I wanted to spend some time with my family in California since it had been a while since we have had a visit with them, or if I wanted to get away from the business of life and go hiking.</p>

<p>As many people who know me can attest I love my family dearly and I love getting away from the chaos and speed of the daily life. So obviously she sparked my interest with those and I spoke up saying so, which helped us narrow it down… slightly… we eliminated a trip somewhere busy and took a cruise off the table for a little while. The cruise was not completely removed purely because of the potential for an Alaskan cruise. Though whenever we mention that there is the somewhat honest response of “we can’t, or we may never return” because of the sheer majesty we have seen in any pictures and videos from Alaska.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to our decision, with the idea of a bigger trip and going to see my family while still getting “off grid” a while she mentioned a backpacking trip. When going through the list of options she mentioned Mount Whitney, somewhere we have both talked about wanting to go (for me it is going again). This idea really hit home, and I loved it for so many reasons.</p>
<ul>
  <li>It gets us out of doors a while and its physically demanding which can help clear away any residual “city” that we feel clinging to us.</li>
  <li>It forces us to get in better shape with some good ‘ole diet and exercise.</li>
  <li>It has the obvious sense of accomplishment for hiking to the highest point in the 48 contiguous states when dealing with an auto-immune disease.</li>
  <li>More than just dealing with an auto-immune disease, one that had stripped all the muscles from Megan’s legs to where I had literally carried her up a small mountain when I proposed to her in California.</li>
  <li>Plus, who doesn’t love the natural beauty of the Sequoia’s and Sierra Nevada mountains I mean look at this picture of Whitney!</li>
</ul>

<p>With the idea and desire for the trip it left us the big task of planning such an adventurous trip. It is by far the largest trip we have been on together and is the biggest excursion I have done even with my scouting career in the past. We were hooked by the prospect though and felt a connection to John Muir with what he says about nature.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Keep close to Nature’s heart… and break clear away, once in a while, and climb a mountain or spend a week in the woods. Wash your spirit clean.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, what was left was the planning and figuring out what we don’t have and what we do need! Plus, the minor detail of getting into shape where hiking 72 miles in elevation didn’t sound like it would defeat us. With Megan in school I took some evening and perhaps some time at work (don’t tell them that) to plan out the rough outline for the trip. Well one thing led to another and I was beyond hooked for the plan, so my “outline” became a bit more like a comprehensive guide. It started off with selecting the route to the peak which as you can tell we decided on fairly quickly to be the High Sierra Trail approach. It is longer than going from Whitney Portal and a more gradual ascent, while being much shorter than taking the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) or John Muir Trail to the peak.</p>

<p>With the route roughly in mind though I realized the hardest people to sell the plan to was going to be our family so my step 2 became clearer… finding out the dangers of the area and how to deal with them. Alongside with the emergency contact information for the zones we would be in.</p>

    <h2>Living Life and Leaving Lupus Behind</h2>
    <p>We are Jason and Megan Crandall, we both have traditional jobs but prefer to spend any time we can out in nature. We currently live in sunny Texas which limits our local excursions when one of you is living with lupus. Managing the symptoms and living life to the max is not always easy, but it is  something that can definitely be done.</p>
